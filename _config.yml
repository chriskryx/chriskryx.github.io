intro: |
  I am a self-taught programmer with 3 years of experience. I have primarily worked in Python, and came across quite some technologies and frameworks thereon such as Django, Web Scraping, Tensorflow and Keras. <br/><br/>
  Nothing can thrill me more than the dopamine of finally finding the solution to a problem.<br/><br/>
  During the past 2 years I have spent a reasonable amount of time building websites for different clients, which has given me an exposure to using WordPress. <br/><br/>
  Have always tried to use my knowledge in Python to automate tasks in my life, such as using web scraping to find companies that might need a better website.<br/><br/>
#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML
additionalinfo: |
   <strong>WordPress</strong>: By using Wordpress I have exposed myself to a little bit of HTML and CSS. I am familiar with most functionalities of WordPress. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Design</strong>: Even though it is not related with my coding experience, knowledge in Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro is part of my skillset as well. I have used them for some side income by freelancing. <br/><br/>
